Variational regular expression library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckaestne/regex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckaestne/regex)
===========

based on [Gnieh Regex](https://travis-ci.org/gnieh/regex), an efficient non backtracking regular expression implementation in scala. This is based on the pikevm as described by [Russ Cox](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/)

reasoning about variability is done with the feature expression library of [TypeChef](https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef).


The library can match regular expressions over streams of optional characters efficiently.
